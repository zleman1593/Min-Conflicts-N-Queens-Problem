To use:

Make sure to have the newest Xcode 6 Installed. This will run in an iOS simulator. It works for the iPad or iPhone. When the simulator is running
you may want to scale down the window to see the full screen.

1. Follow UI Instructions in App.

2. Mostly Relevant for prolonged testing (Make sure to Run the Simulator as the front most app to prevent Mac AppNap from making the simulator slow down).

Notes:
Boards above 250 are not shown because individual spots are too small to see individual queens

MinConflicts code is located in the MinConflicts.swift file
Line 89 is where the algorithms start. All algorithms share code to avoid copy and paste coding.
Optimal initial placement: Lines 56-62
See cases starting at Line 106 for all other algorithms.

PickBestFirst variant is implemented by adding a few lines to the bestMovesForQueen method that are switched on by a boolean variable.


Feel free to move queens around on the board before solving. Just click or touch.



--------------------------------

No longer Relevant: (UI Element to access this has been removed.)

3. To see averages you can use the test mode button. Test can be customized in the viewController.swift file
    a. See runAllTestsWithNQueens function
    b.  The following two lines run the three initial algorithms and the three modifications to vanilla respectively.
        1. Arguments: (Trials, Queens, Max Steps):
            self.runTestForThreeBasicAlgorithms(10, queens: 10, steps: 500)
            self.runThreeTestOnBestAlgorithm(10, queens: 10, steps: 500)
        2. As many of these lines with any combination of parameters can be written in the runAllTestsWithNQueens function.
