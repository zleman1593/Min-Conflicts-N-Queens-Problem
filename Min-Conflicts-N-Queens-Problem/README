3. To see averages you can use the test mode button. Test can be customized in the viewController.swift file
    a. See runAllTestsWithNQueens function
    b.  The following two lines run the three initial algorithms and the three modifications to vanilla respectively.
        1. Arguments: (Trials, Queens, Max Steps):
            self.runTestForThreeBasicAlgorithms(10, queens: 10, steps: 500)
            self.runThreeTestOnBestAlgorithm(10, queens: 10, steps: 500)
        2. As many of these lines with any combination of parameters can be written in the runAllTestsWithNQueens function.


Notes:
Boards above 250 are not shown as individual spots are too small to see individual queens
